#### ABOUT ME


---

I enjoy playing chess, online gaming, and having fun in various activities.

My academic journey began with Mechatronic Engineering studies at the University of South Africa, though I faced personal challenges that interrupted my degree completion.

Later, I discovered my passion for data science and excelled in the field, drawing on my programming background from engineering.

In addition to my data science proficiency, I hold certification as a Data Management Professional from DAMA International. This certification reflects my dedication to high standards in data management practices.

Furthermore, I am a Certified Microsoft T-SQL programmer. You can verify both certifications by clicking on the respective badges below my profile picture.

### Projects in progress 2024:
# AI Communication Coach (in progress)

## Current Functionality:
- **Speech Recognition**: Capture and analyze user speech
- **Text Analysis**: Perform sentiment analysis, keyword extraction, and named entity recognition
- **LLM Integration**: Use pre-trained LLMs to generate responses based on user input

[Video showcasing the initial features](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jermaine-varnicker-315a8794_ai-huggingface-nlp-activity-7202029374018121729-yyri?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

## Future Development:
- Enhance response generation using the LLM with context awareness and conversation history
- Integrate feedback mechanisms to improve the coach's responses over time
- Explore additional features like voice synthesis for coach responses or sentiment visualization

## Tools used:
- **Python**: Programming Language
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Development environment
- **SpeechRecognition**: Speech Recognition
- **NLP Libraries**: NLTK, spaCy, TextBlob
- **Transformers**: Hugging Face Transformers for text generation
- **(Optional) OpenCV**: Computer Vision for future features
