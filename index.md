#### ABOUT ME


---
I enjoy playing chess, online gaming and just having fun.


Before entering the field of data science, I studied Mechatronic Engineering at the University of South Africa but I was unable to complete my degree after falling on some difficult times. 

Later I was presented with the opportunity to study data science and having already had a background in programming thanks to my engineering studies I was able to perform exceptionally well as a student in the field.

I am also a Certified Mcrosoft T-SQL programmer, please click on the Microsoft badge below my profile picture should you wish to verify my certification.
