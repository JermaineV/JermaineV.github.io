  Welcome to My Data Science Portfolio
  <br><br>
  
  ABOUT ME
  <br><br>

  I enjoy playing chess, online gaming and just having fun.
  
  Before entering the field of data science, I studied Mechatronic Engineering at the University of South Africa but I was unable to complete my degree after falling on some difficult times. 
  Later I was presented with the opportunity to study data science and having already had a background in programming thanks to my engineering studies I was able to perform exceptionally well as a student in the field.
  I am also a Certified Mcrosoft T-SQL programmer, below is a link to my accretied badge.
