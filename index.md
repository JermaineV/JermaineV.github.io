#### ABOUT ME

I enjoy playing chess, online gaming, and having fun in various activities.

My academic journey began with Mechatronic Engineering studies at the University of South Africa, though I faced personal challenges that interrupted my degree completion.

Later, I discovered my passion for data science and excelled in the field, drawing on my programming background from engineering.

In addition to my data science proficiency, I hold certification as a Data Management Professional from DAMA International. This certification reflects my dedication to high standards in data management practices.

Furthermore, I am a Certified Microsoft T-SQL programmer. You can verify my certifications by clicking on the respective badges below.

### Projects in progress 2024:

#### [AI Communication Coach (in progress)](https://github.com/JermaineV/AI_Coach)

This project aims to develop a platform that utilizes Artificial Intelligence (AI) to assist users in improving their communication skills for public speaking and interviews.

[![AI Communication Coach Image](https://github.com/JermaineV/JermaineV.github.io/blob/9485850cfc3d0007e00998eb6b26f9225f5d1721/images/botpic.jpeg?raw=true)](https://github.com/JermaineV/AI_Coach)

**Current Functionality:**
- Speech Recognition: Capture and analyze user speech
- Text Analysis: Perform sentiment analysis, keyword extraction, and named entity recognition
- LLM Integration: Use pre-trained LLMs to generate responses based on user input

[Video showcasing the current features](https://1drv.ms/v/s!AuRvf69NQWuRqGrrkG9EW8cE-o4z?e=Amhrcv)

**Future Development:**
